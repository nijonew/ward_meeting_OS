# Ward OS — Project Context for Claude Code

Next.js / TypeScript / Tailwind app on Vercel, Supabase backend. LDS ward
meeting planning: agendas, assignments, rotations, sacrament program
publishing, announcements, youth activities.

**Production domain (always test/verify here, never a Vercel preview URL):**
https://ward-meeting-os.vercel.app

## Current migration number: 021

Next migration should be `022_*.sql`. Migrations are plain `.sql` files at
the repo root, run manually by the user in the Supabase SQL editor (no
migration tool/CLI wired up). Always make migrations idempotent
(`DROP ... IF EXISTS` before `CREATE`) since partial-failure re-runs are
common. Confirm the next free number with the user before assuming — a
numbering collision with something run outside this chat has happened
before.

## Architecture

- **Auth:** email/password (not magic link — that was broken and replaced).
  First-time users must visit `/auth/reset-password` once to set a password.
- **Roles** (`profiles.role`, fixed enum, not yet configurable):
  `bishopric` (bishop + counselors + exec sec + clerk, one shared role),
  `music_planner`, `communications_specialist`, plus granular youth roles
  `yw_presidency`, `yw_advisor`, `yw_specialist`, `ym_advisor`, `ym_specialist`
  (kept granular on purpose, not consolidated).
- **Landing page** (`app/page.tsx`): one shared URL for everyone. Tiles are
  filtered in/out by login state + role. Tapping a tile navigates to that
  feature's own page — the landing page is a router, not a replacement for
  feature pages.
- **Meeting types:** Sacrament Meeting, Bishopric Meeting, Ward Council,
  Youth Council. Lifecycle: `template → planning → review → ready → live →
  archived`. "Published" (ready/live) = public program is print-ready
  (music/speakers/prayers/conducting/presiding finalized) but explicitly
  excludes ward business/announcements, which only get folded in at
  `archived`.
- **Dynamic planning view** (`app/meetings/[id]/planning/page.tsx`): renders
  each meeting type's configured template elements (from the element
  catalog, `meeting_elements`/`meeting_templates`) in order, dispatching by
  `resolution_kind` (`person_role`, `music`, `person_slot`, `free_text`,
  `person_and_text`, `none`). Most element types write to existing tables
  (`sacrament_assignments`, `sacrament_music`, `sacrament_speakers_adults/
  youth`); anything without a clean existing home writes to the generic
  `meeting_element_notes` table.
- **Assignment Rotations** (`/rotations`): 7 elements rotate automatically
  (Conducting, Opening/Closing Prayer ×3 meeting types, Chorister, Organist,
  Spiritual Thought, Handbook Training presenter). Speaker/Youth Speaker and
  Presiding/Pianist intentionally do NOT rotate — `/speaker-prayer-history`
  is the manual tool that compensates for that. A rotation's "next" pointer
  advances once per meeting *created*, not per save, so a one-off override
  doesn't skip anyone in future weeks.
- **Meeting Schedule** (`/meeting-schedule`): cadence rules
  (`meeting_schedule_rules`) drive a "Generate Meetings" action. Three
  cadence shapes: `weekly`, `nth_weekday` (e.g. "3rd Tuesday"), `relative`
  (e.g. "2 days after the 3rd Sunday" — computed from the anchor each month,
  not stored as its own fixed nth-weekday, since which numbered weekday that
  lands on varies month to month).
- **RLS:** enabled on every table (app uses the anon key everywhere, not
  service role). Most tables: any authenticated user, app code already
  gates by role. A handful of public-facing tables (announcements,
  sacrament program data, youth/ward events) have narrow anon policies
  scoped to exactly what the public UI already filters to client-side
  (`confirmed = true`, `status = 'published'`, etc.) — don't loosen these
  without checking what the public pages actually expose.

## Known open items

- Teaching Calendar (youth leader tile) — scope not yet defined, deferred
- Bishopric-side free-text elements (spiritual thought, handbook training,
  young men coordination, impressions, calling planning, sacrament meeting
  review) can currently be entered in TWO places — new dynamic per-element
  fields AND the old `BishopricMinutesForm`'s similarly-named fixed columns.
  Not consolidated yet; ask before changing either.
- `AssignmentsForm.tsx` / `BishopricAssignmentsForm.tsx` are unused legacy
  components (superseded by the dynamic planning view) — safe to delete,
  never got around to it.
- Agenda items for Bishopric/Ward Council/Youth Council should eventually
  get a share-token-based no-login view for invited attendees (security
  through an unguessable link, not auth) — not built yet.
- Dashboard shows every meeting, past and future, oldest first —
  `getUpcomingMeetings()` (lib/data/meetings.ts) has no date or stage
  filter at all despite the name. Two follow-ups noticed while using it
  day to day (2026-09-04), not yet built:
  - **Auto-archive past meetings.** Once a meeting's date has passed: if
    real data was entered for it (assignments/music/planning/notes rows
    exist for that meeting_id), move its `stage` to `archived`
    automatically instead of leaving it sitting in whatever stage it was
    last saved at. If nothing was ever entered, don't force it to
    `archived` — mark it some other way (e.g. a "No activity" badge) so
    it's visually distinct from a past meeting that was actually run.
    Needs a decision before building: what exactly counts as "data was
    added" (which tables/columns to check per meeting type), and how the
    transition gets triggered (computed on dashboard render vs. a
    scheduled job vs. a manual "Archive past meetings" action).
  - **Cancel a meeting from the dashboard.** A status control separate
    from the planning-progress `stage` field — something like
    Scheduled/Cancelled, with a reason when cancelled. Likely a new
    column (or two) on `meetings` rather than overloading `stage`, since
    `stage` tracks how far along the program is, not whether the meeting
    is happening at all. Lower priority than the auto-archive item.

## Working conventions

- Always run a syntax/type check before considering something done:
  `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint <files>`.
- Verify SQL migrations are idempotent and re-runnable before handing off.
- User is not a professional developer — prefer concrete, step-by-step
  instructions over concept-level explanations when something needs their
  action (e.g. Supabase dashboard steps).
